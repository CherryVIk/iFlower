# iFlower
IOS app for detecting what kind of flower is on the user's picture. Flower classifier MLmodel is used


Actually, I had some difficulties importing all my comits with files from Xcode because the ML-model is too large. 
I was afraid of losing whole my project if I delete local repository. So I decided import all files on my own. 
It's not likely to work properly if you try to clone the project -  ML-model is absent and some files are not correctly imported.
I wish you luck)
